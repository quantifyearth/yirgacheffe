# A UniformAreaLayer is a hack for the fact that we have these raster layers
# that represent the area of each pixel in WSG84, and they're all the same
# value across the layer, but the GeoTIFFs are super slow to unpack. Thus the
# work around is to make these GeoTIFFS that are just one column of pixels,
# and this layer pretends that it's a 360 degree wide layer.
